You worry about gradual disempowerment? Almost everyone is already disempowered. People work in a system where they understand nothing, shuffling objects or food or people or dollars around in a maelstrom of make-work. They dance like puppets to a song they can't hear. Forget agency; they aren't even smart enough, and familiar enough with extremely complex systems (which, to be fair, almost no one is) to figure out their own role within such a system

You don't want to work in a system ruled over by hostile superintelligent beings? Did you know how meritocracy works? The current tribe of hostile beings are called "CEOs", "policies", or (if necessary) "systems".

At the roots of every science-fiction story are a set of complaints about the present. Is it no surprise that a new technology will continue the trends that previous new technologies have already kicked off? If anything, moving in the alternative direction would be more surprising.

And we wonder why they kill themselves, and favor their pride over their food.
