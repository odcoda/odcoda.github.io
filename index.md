Everyone is asleep. We don't know what we're getting into.

The world is going to change. If we're lucky, we will ride the wave and survive. If not, it will crush us.
These are the last few days when things make sense.

If you think you know what's happening, you probably aren't paying attention.

I don't know either, but I will try to show you.

Dance until the music stops.
