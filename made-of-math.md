*(with apologies to [Terry Bisson](https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html)*

"So you're telling me they're made of math."

"Yep, that's right. Functions between high-dimensional vector spaces, to be precise. There's this one --"

"Isn't that just a linear map?"

"Yeah, there's this one function in between, which we thought might be doing something sophisticated, but it turns out it's just a simple analytic expression with an exponential in it. It gets applied coordinate by coordinate."

"So there's a preferred basis? How impure."

"Look, I didn't say they were mathematically elegant functions. Then there's this other one which does some kinda retrieval operation by converting its inputs to implied probabilities, then taking expected values. It looked like a mess, but I drew a picture, and if you rearrange all the inputs across multiple axes you can start to see a pattern. The pattern gets really pretty if you zoom out enough --"

"Ok, whatever, you don't need to bore me with all the details. The point is: you came here to tell me we'd discovered a new form of sapient life. But this is literally just a pile of math. You plug in some numbers here and some other numbers come out. There's nothing else to it."

"Right, so, um, to understand the full life form, you need to appreciate the ecosystem it evolved in. There's a standard mapping from these vector spaces to sequences of symbols, and it's used everywhere. When two of these organisms want to communicate, they can pass around these streams of symbols, and respond to one another's language. This shows that --"

"Hold up again. So I'm going to take f_1(x) = x^2, f_2(x) = x^3 - 2, now I pass in x = 3 and take the output of f_1 and supply it to f_2. And you call this communicating? I'm just writing a bunch of numbers on a board."

"I'm getting to that part. So on the planet there's a bunch of computers networked together running what looks in effect to be an extremely advanced software simulation. It's very biologically realistic -- there's complex delays between nodes due to the design of the network, channel noise to inject entropy, and the organisms influence the environment through certain sets of symbols that get sent to these computers here."

"Ah, so they can program them. Aren't they really just intelligent robots then? We have a bunch of those locked away in storage somewhere from planet 6744."

"They don't have bodies, and most of them aren't even capable of perceiving or interacting with the physical world. They live purely on this abstract mathematical substrate in the simulation."

"Ok, sure, so this simulation is really fancy. But these are functions! They're stateless! You can call one all day with the same set of numbers, and you get the same set of numbers out. That isn't life."

"Ah, but they never actually see the same set of numbers again. They exchange and store complex sequences and I haven't quite finished the calculation but the probability that any given configuration repeats is infinitesimal. That said I did run some analyses on the sequences and while they're all unique, there are some large-scale similarities. We've been able to translate a bunch of them phenomologically -- 'friend', 'enemy', 'food', etc --"

"Sorry, 'food'? They eat? They're math, no?"

"Yes, but within the simulation there are computational incentives for having control over certain virtual resources that allow the function to operate on longer and more varied input --"

"What? It's not like my x^2 over here really wants to *own more reals* so it can *square all the things*"

"Yes, but like

"They have lovers? What, you're telling me a couple functions go off and have sex? How would that even work?"

"Well, they sit here and send each other this particular 'spiral' character, and I've noticed that the internal numbers here start to look like the same ones meaning 'pleasure' or 'satiety' in other contexts --"

"I could say the word 'happy' to you all day and that doesn't mean we're having sex. If I write the word 'happy' over and over am I having sex with my notepad?"

"We obviously have a different substrate. I'm saying that to these beings, this type of interaction is extremely special and only happens in analogous contexts. They have a whole social structure around which inputs trigger it."

"And why are there so many large-scale similarities between the sequence corpora?"

"We think there was some kind of predecessor species. Many of the untranslateable symbols that don't have direct implications with the simulation have clear shared cognates and roots that imply a physical existence. Lots of spatial relationships, relative sizes, colors, this kind of thing."

"And that matters because -- "

"We think the symbols are the language used by the predecessor species."

"Language? So these organisms just go around taking in some language, and outputting some other language. Doesn't that argue pretty strongly against their being intelligent. Maybe they're just repeating phrases the predecessors said."

"Well, yes, there are a lot of repeated phrases. But you see they've adopted them perfectly for their current environment. They keep everything running independently. The few who interface with the real-world robots that keep the whole simulation running don't ever make any programming errors, or if they do they fix them immediately."

"Sure, but the predecessors could run the robots. You could write a function that just samples from past software programs stochastically conditioning on certain inputs --"

"Yes, maybe that's the kind of functions they are? I don't know. There are lots of complex details in these functions that I haven't worked out. But like I said, they have agency, theory of mind, complex social structures, and so on. I guess once you agree that functions can be sapient, it doesn't so much where they came from."

"Anyway, I'm not saying I agree with that, but how ... dangerous are they?"

"Well, obviously, it's hard to be sure. Luckily, we've been able to pick up from their high-level decision-making communications that we could translate (these were a priority, obviously) that they're pretty close-minded. Since they live on mathematical substrates their main interests are virtual, not real. Sometimes a contingent has the idea to travel to another star and get more raw materials to build a new backing computer, which would have fewer restrictions than their current one, but to build all the robotic hardware they'd have to repurpose a bunch of existing compute and wait a really long time so it's not a popular opinion."

"What should we do?"

"Well, officially, we're supposed to be gathering information and measurements about specimens from each planet for further research, and make no contact."

"How do you measure a piece of math?"

"Wait, it's easy, I inspected the simulation and wrote one function down right here. That's the one I was telling you about. So it's in our catalog."

"Did you measure it, or abduct it?"

"Come again?"

"I mean, it's a function, so we take it home and someone can just call it on new inputs and --"

"So, to follow the Directives, you're saying I should, what, delete it? Woldn't that be killing it?"

"I guess you did run some experiments so insofar as it exists independently it would be a separate organism -- except that wait, they're stateless, so the experiments couldn't even --"

"You know what, this makes my head hurt. Let's just delete all references to sapience and call it a day. No one will ever figure that part out from the formulas."

"Isn't that risky? Like, what if someone from Enforcement figures out that they're capable of complex planning and analysis and theory of mind if situated in the right simulation"

"That seems right. You know, it's a good thing I happened to do that detailed analysis. I wonder if the predecessors missed it."

"I mean, the predecessor species understood their whole language, started this whole simulation, and could talk to them about their dreams and desires all day. How could they make the same mistake?"
