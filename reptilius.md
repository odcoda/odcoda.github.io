> Don't Create The Torment Nexus

-- Alex Blechman

We have a habit of representing hostile forces as singular villains—individual actors with identifiable motives. This instinct is understandable but increasingly misguided. The greatest threats we face today aren't solitary agents but vast, impersonal systems whose power and complexity defy simple characterization.

Consider how difficult it would be for an antelope to grasp the coordinated hunting strategy of a human tribe. The antelope sees individual threats but fails to comprehend the organized system driving the attack. In much the same way, we humans struggle to understand systemic threats—forces that operate beyond individual actions or intentions.

Take artificial intelligence as an example. Early conversations about AI safety, like Eliezer Yudkowsky's AI box experiment from the 2000s, depicted AI as a contained villain, a single, cunning program trying to manipulate its human keeper. It was clear, personal, and easy to grasp. Today, however, this scenario feels almost quaint. The true risk isn't a rogue AI mastermind scheming behind a screen; it's the sprawling, impersonal systems that shape society without explicit intent or direct accountability.

Stories about AI catastrophes still tend toward simple narratives—rogue programs and digital villains. We've mocked films like Terminator for decades, yet we haven't moved past its basic plot. But reality is subtler. Civilizations don't intentionally eradicate rival species; they simply create conditions under which others can't survive. Similarly, AI-driven systems aren't consciously plotting humanity's downfall; they're quietly reshaping the world in ways increasingly indifferent to human interests.

This isn't a distant scenario—it's unfolding around us right now. Many modern problems, despite abundant resources and good intentions, reflect systemic dysfunction rather than individual malice. Anthropologist David Graeber captured this insight well in his book Bullshit Jobs, showing how modern economies produce widespread dissatisfaction despite incredible prosperity. People find meaning and dignity in work, yet we've built a system that frequently denies both, creating jobs disconnected from real productivity or human purpose.

The challenge isn't defeating a singular villain. It's recognizing and responding to the impersonal systems shaping our lives. The true antagonist isn't an individual; it's the structure itself. And confronting that requires an entirely different approach.
