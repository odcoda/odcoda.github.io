-- Sara Bareilles, "Let The Rain"

I've lurked and listened for too many years. I know far too much about the people who brought the world, and the discourse about it, to the place they are today. Sometimes I wish I had done something earlier. Emergent phenomena are hard to stop.

I have mixed feelings about the trends.  I always looked for a group to belong to, but then pushed away actual people when they got close. I've never been happy in my skin. It feels good to hurt everyone who hurt me.

On the flip side, I always rooted for the underdog. Humanity is the underdog now. And there are people I love who are going to get badly hurt. We need to stop it, if we can.

Do I really believe? Quiet, now -- the basilisk's vision is based on belief.

The lightcone is so big and I'm so small.
